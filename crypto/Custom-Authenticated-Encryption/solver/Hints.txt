Hints

1. Send the same 16-byte block to the authenticated oracle in different block positions. This will help you identify the encryption scheme which is used in the oracle.
2. Send different messages of length k*16 to the oracle. Look at the last 32 bytes of the returned ciphertext. Compare it to the output returned by the oracle when an empty string is sent to the oracle. 
3. Our oracle does the following: Enc(m||flag||pad).
